## 🎓 Learning Tips

### 1. **Code Every Day**
Even 30 minutes of daily practice is better than 3 hours once a week.

### 2. **Type, Don't Copy**
Type out the examples yourself. This builds muscle memory.

### 3. **Understand, Don't Memorize**
Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing syntax.

### 4. **Debug Your Own Code**
Errors are learning opportunities. Try to fix them before looking for help.

### 5. **Build Projects**
Apply what you learn by building real projects.

### 6. **Read Others' Code**
Look at open-source projects to see how experienced developers write code.

### 7. **Ask Questions**
Use Stack Overflow, Reddit (r/learnpython), or Python Discord communities.
